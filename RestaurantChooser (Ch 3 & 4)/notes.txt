To fix problem with native-base components not being found (as per https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/1075):
  In \node_modules\native-base\index.d.ts: comment the imports:
    //import * as React from "react";
    //import * as ReactNative from "react-native";


In environment settings of the run configuration there is a REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME variable that defines the IP
address Expo listens on.  If it's not configured you SHOULD get an IP valid for the network the machine is on, but if
not you can set a value here to force it.
